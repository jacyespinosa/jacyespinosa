<br> I am a self-taught Full Stack Developer. I call myself a “student of life” because I am a person with internal drive and curiosity to explore and learn new things. 
I believe being a Full Stack Developer is a constant learning experience, and I love to learn. Most importantly, I enjoy the process of starting a project from scratch, going through the ups and downs like a roller coaster, and seeing the final product, is a feeling like no other. 
<br> <br> 
💪 Skills: Python, Flask, SqlAlchemy, PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

🌱 I’m currently learning React.

🔭 I’m currently working on cloning <a href='https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/'>Wordle</a>.

😀 I like to play the guitar, listen to music and play video games on my leisure time.
