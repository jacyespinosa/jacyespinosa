<br> I am a self-taught Full Stack Developer. I call myself a “student of life” because I am a person with internal drive and curiosity to explore and learn new things. 
I believe being a Full Stack Developer is a constant learning experience, and I love to learn. Most importantly, I enjoy the process of starting a project from scratch, going through the ups and downs like a roller coaster, and seeing the final product, is a feeling like no other.
